# How to run this
 you can split your terminal and run the necessary commands for your project in each one. Here's a clearer and more organized way to set it up:

1. **First Terminal: Start the NPM server**

   In the first terminal window, navigate to your project directory and start your NPM server:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

2. **Second Terminal: Navigate to the client directory and run the server with nodemon**

   In the second terminal window, navigate to the client directory and run your server with nodemon:

   ```sh
   cd client
   nodemon server.js
   ```

This setup allows you to monitor and control both processes simultaneously.
